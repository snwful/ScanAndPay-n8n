Feedback Instructions for Codex

After completing the code refactor, provide a concise report covering the following points:

Summary of Changes – Describe the major modifications you made (e.g., removed dynamic QR generation, added QR image field, simplified verification payload) and how they satisfy the requirements.

Potential Issues or Blind Spots – Note any assumptions or areas that might need further clarification. For example, if the Media Library field required custom JavaScript, mention that it may need additional testing across different WordPress versions.

Future Improvements – Suggest forward‑thinking enhancements, such as integrating the real bank verification API, handling different currencies, or improving the UI for slip verification.

Structure the feedback as bullet points or short paragraphs. Aim to be honest and constructive, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of the solution.
