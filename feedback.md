Feedback Instructions for Codex

After completing the code refactor, provide a concise report covering the following points:

Summary of Changes – Describe the major modifications you made (e.g., removed custom QR payload logic, embedded `[promptpayqr amount="…"]` using the PromptPay plugin’s ID, simplified verification payload, added fallback SVG when shortcode is unavailable) and how they satisfy the requirements.

Potential Issues or Blind Spots – Note any assumptions or areas that might need further clarification. For example: dependency on the PromptPay plugin being active (shortcode available), ensuring the amount passed to the shortcode is a plain float (no currency symbols), and the absence of AJAX re-rendering for `update_checkout` (planned) or WooCommerce Blocks support (planned).

Future Improvements – Suggest forward‑thinking enhancements, such as AJAX-based QR re-rendering on checkout updates, WooCommerce Blocks support, integrating the real bank verification API, handling different currencies, or improving the UI for slip verification.

Structure the feedback as bullet points or short paragraphs. Aim to be honest and constructive, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of the solution.
