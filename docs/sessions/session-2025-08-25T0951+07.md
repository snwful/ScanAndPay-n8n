# Session Log â€” 2025-08-25 09:51 +07

- Actor: Cascade
- Correlation-ID: n/a

## Summary
Established a persistent documentation workflow to ensure continuity: always re-read core docs before work; after each edit, record a session log and update a developer changelog.

## Context / Goal
User requested long-term memory and portable documentation across machines. Anchored to `plan.md` goals and `AGENTS.md` operational rules.

## Changes
- Added `docs/PROCESS.md` (workflow and checklist)
- Added templates: `docs/templates/SESSION_TEMPLATE.md`, `docs/templates/ADR_TEMPLATE.md`
- Added `docs/CHANGELOG.md` and this session log

## Diffs & References
- Docs only; no code behavior changed
- Related docs referenced: `plan.md`, `readme.txt`, `instructions.md`, `context.md`, `evaluation.md`, `feedback.md`, `AGENTS.md`

## Tests / Validation
- Verified files created and readable in repo

## Next Steps
- Use this process for every subsequent change
- Consider adding a PR template if moving to VCS-hosted workflow

## Risks / Notes
- Keep secrets out of logs; mask PII. Update `plan.md` tasks when process affects scope.
